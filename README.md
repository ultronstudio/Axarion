## 🚀 Quick Start

### Your First Game (5 Minutes)
```python
from engine.core import AxarionEngine
from engine.game_object import GameObject
import pygame

# Initialize pygame first
pygame.init()

# Create engine
engine = AxarionEngine(800, 600, "My First Game")

# Initialize with error handling
try:
    if not engine.initialize():
        print("⚠️ Engine didn't initialize correctly, but continuing...")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"⚠️ Initialization error: {e}")

# Create scene
scene = engine.create_scene("GameScene")
engine.current_scene = scene

# Create player object
player = GameObject("Player", "rectangle")
player.position = (100, 100)
player.set_property("width", 40)
player.set_property("height", 40)
player.set_property("color", (100, 200, 255))
player.is_static = True

# Add to scene
scene.add_object(player)

# Game loop
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
speed = 200

while engine.running:
    delta_time = clock.tick(60) / 1000.0
    
    # Handle events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            engine.stop()
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
                engine.stop()
    
    # Handle input
    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    x, y = player.position
    
    if keys[pygame.K_w] or keys[pygame.K_UP]:
        player.position = (x, y - speed * delta_time)
    if keys[pygame.K_s] or keys[pygame.K_DOWN]:
        player.position = (x, y + speed * delta_time)
    if keys[pygame.K_a] or keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
        player.position = (x - speed * delta_time, y)
    if keys[pygame.K_d] or keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
        player.position = (x + speed * delta_time, y)
    
    # Update and render
    if engine.current_scene:
        engine.current_scene.update(delta_time)
    
    if engine.renderer:
        engine.renderer.clear()
        if engine.current_scene:
            engine.current_scene.render(engine.renderer)
        engine.renderer.present()

engine.cleanup()
```

## 🎮 Core Systems

### Game Object Types
| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `rectangle` | Rectangular collision shapes | Platforms, walls, UI elements |
| `circle` | Circular collision shapes | Balls, coins, projectiles |
| `sprite` | Image-based objects | Characters, items, decorations |
| `animated_sprite` | Frame-animated objects | Walking characters, spinning coins |

### Core Engine Features
```python
# Movement & Physics
player.move(dx, dy)                    # Relative movement
player.position = (x, y)               # Absolute positioning
player.apply_force(fx, fy)             # Physics-based forces
player.velocity = (vx, vy)             # Direct velocity control

# Input Handling
engine.input.is_key_pressed("w")       # Check if key is held
engine.input.is_key_just_pressed(" ")  # Check for single key press
engine.input.is_mouse_clicked(0)       # Left mouse button
engine.input.get_mouse_position()      # Current mouse coordinates

# Audio & Effects
engine.audio.play_sound("explosion")   # Play sound effect
engine.audio.play_music("background")  # Background music
engine.particles.create_explosion(x, y) # Particle explosion
engine.particles.create_trail(x, y, color) # Particle trail

# Game Logic
scene.find_objects_by_tag("enemy")     # Find objects by tag
player.is_colliding_with(enemy)        # Collision detection
engine.math.distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)   # Calculate distance
scene.create_object("enemy", x, y)     # Spawn new objects
```
